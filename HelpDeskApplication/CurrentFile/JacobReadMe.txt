Current Admin User:
 - The table should only show users that are of the "Admin" status
 - The "Delete" button will delete the selected user as an admin so that the deleted admin can not use the admin section again.

Current Users:
- The table will only show users of the Student status.
- The "Delete" button will delete that selected user so that they are no longer able to use the application.
- The "Query User Data" button should show all of the clock in and clock out entries for that selected user.

Add Users:
- This section should take all the filed out sections and give it to the SQL query used to insert a user.
- The 3 sections that the admin fills out should not be empty. They must have something in them.
- After the admin clicks Add User it should run the insert query with the filled out information,
 and insert the user to the database then return to the admin page where they clicked the Add User button.
